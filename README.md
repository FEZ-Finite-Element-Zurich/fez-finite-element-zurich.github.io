# Landing Page for [FEZurich](https://fez-finite-element-zurich.github.io/)

For those maintaining the FEZ landing page. You can use this repository as a staging environment (i.e. an imitation of the real thing in the FEZ organization) to test if your changes to the website are what you envisioned before 'deploying' it to the actual landing page (i.e. forked repository in FEZ organization).

## Website basics

This website was built with HTML, CSS, & a little bit of JavaScript (JS). In a nutshell, **HTML** provides the content of a website, **CSS** styles the content (e.g. fonts, colors, spacing, etc.), and **JS** adds interactivity (e.g. animations, or in this case, interacting with external websites via APIs).
