# Landing Page for [FEZurich](https://fez-finite-element-zurich.github.io/)

For those maintaining the FEZ landing page. You can use this repository as a staging environment (i.e. an imitation of the real thing in the FEZ organization) to test if your changes to the website are what you envisioned before 'deploying' it to the actual landing page (i.e. forked repository in FEZ organization).

## Website basics

This website was built with HTML, CSS, & a little bit of JavaScript (JS). In a nutshell:
- **HTML** provides the content of a website,
- **CSS** styles the content (e.g. fonts, colors, spacing, etc.), and
- **JS** adds interactivity (e.g. animations, or in this case, interacting with external websites via APIs).

There are many tutorials online that will go into much more depth than what is described here. JS will not be explained...you shoud not have to touch anything in the JS file to update the FEZ website.

### HTML basic syntax

`<element attr="some_attribute"> [...content...]</element>`

To update the FEZ website, you'll be copy and pasting code chunks or HTML elements into the .html files of the repository.

An element is defined by an opening and closing tag name which is in our example above `<element></element>`

Within the opening tag, you can define attributes for the element that will help format how it looks and functions when a user looks at the website online. Common tags for styling the look of html are `class` and `id`

### CSS basic syntax
